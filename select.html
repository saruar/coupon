<p style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Attention Debit Card Users</strong></p>

<p>Please be aware that an attempted purchase with a bank debit card, even if the purchase is declined, will result in a temporary deduction from the account associated with the debit card. This deduction will be credited back to the account within several days of the attempted transaction. The timeframe of the charge being reversed is determined by the bank or institution issuing the debit card. Customers with duplicate charges on their debit card must contact their bank or institution with questions about the status of these charges. We are not responsible for duplicate charges to any account associated with a debit card. In order to avoid duplicate charges, please only click on process order once.</p>
